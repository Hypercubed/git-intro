					# Intro to Git</h1>
					#### Jayson Harshbarger

					Note:
					I'm going to try something different today.  Instead of showing my work (which at this moment is preliminarily Jordan's connectome visualization, which you have seen a dozen times), I'm going to introduce you to a tool I use everyday.  A tool improves my quality of life.

						Note:
						I think everyone pretty much knows the reason behind version control.  This is version control... maybe not a very good one.

						## Why version control

						- backup
						- transparency
						- reproducibility
						- recovery from errors
						- collaboration

						<p/>

						"If you're doing any kind of scientific computing and not using version control, you're doing it wrong." - Stephen Turner, Bioinformatics Core at the University of Virginia.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

						## Why not git?

						- "Git is too hard"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

						- "I already use CVS/SVN"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

						- "I don't share"<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

						Note:
						These are a few things I''ve heard when I''ve mention GIT.  My goal here is not to get you to use git... rather I want to address these three points.  (space) I don''t think git is hard, it has a somewhat steep learning curve but definatly not as hard as say... facebook.  (space) If you use another version control system and you are happy, keep at it.  I want to show that git is different, not necessaryly better.  (space) Finally, git is for you.  On your pc or workstation.  It''s not about shareing or collaborating.  While it has some features that help in this matter git, the commandline tool, is a too to help you in your local workflow.
					</script>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## What GIT not.

						- GIT not a GUI, it is a command line tool<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
						- GIT != GitHub<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
						- GIT is not an version control server<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

					</script>
					</section>			

					<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
						## Why git?
						
						- free and open source
						- distributed, work locally
						- command line
						- fast and lean
						- easy <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> 

					</script></section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Git vs. Whatever
						- Not better, different
						- No server required, Off-line
						- Tracks content not files
						- Branches are lightweight

						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							This is a basic git workflow.  After making changes to files, you review those changes, stage changes, and commit. (space) These map to the three fundamental git commands that we'll discuss today.  Plus one more. 
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					# git init
					#### Initialize a new Git repository

					- Create a new empty repository in the current folder
					- Does not changes any files you have already created

					```(bash)
					> cd mywork
					> git init

					Initialized empty Git repository in /Scratch/mywork/.git/

					> ll -a

					.git/
					data/
					mydoc.txt
					scripts/
					```

					Note:
					git init a new empty repository in the current folder.  If you see here I'm c-d-ed into an exsiting project.  Git init creates a single hidden `.git` directory.  My existing files are not touched at all.

				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### (2. Review changes)
						# git status
						### 

						```(bash)
						> git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Untracked files:
						#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
						#
						#       data/
						#       mydoc.txt
						#       scripts/
						nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
						```

						Note:
						git status shows a status for teh current git repository.  You can see that I have one file and two fodlers in this directory that are not currently tracked.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						#### (2. Review changes)
						# git diff
						### 

						```(bash)
						> git diff
						diff --git a/scripts/myscript.sh b/scripts/myscript.sh
						index 9daeafb..038d718 100644
						--- a/scripts/myscript.sh
						+++ b/scripts/myscript.sh
						@@ -1 +1 @@
						-test
						+testing
						```

						Note:
						git diff is not one of the core commands I mentioned but it helpful for seeing exactly what changes were made.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### (3. Stage changes)
					# git add
					### 

					- Doesn't alter files
					- Add only what you want

					```(bash)
					> git add mydoc.txt scripts/

					> git status
					# On branch master
					#
					# Initial commit
					#
					# Changes to be committed:
					#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
					#
					#       new file:   mydoc.txt
					#       new file:   scripts/myscript.sh
					#
					# Untracked files:
					#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
					#
					#       data/
					```

					Note:
					`git add` tells git that you want to include the current version of a file in the next commit. It doesn't alter the file at all.  Later when you make a change to a file you run `git add` again to say you want those changes.  Notice that I didn't add my data/ folder.  You don't need to add everything.
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							#### (4. Commit changes)
							# git commit
							### Save the state of a single or collection of changes.

							```
							> git commit -m "First commit"
							[master (root-commit) 5053e8c] First commit
							 0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
							 create mode 100644 mydoc.txt
							 create mode 100644 scripts/myscript.sh

							> ll -a

							.git/
							data/
							mydoc.txt
							scripts/
							```

							- Shortcut: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->`git commit -am "Second"` 

							Note:
							git commit takes all the changes you staged in step three (3) and commits them to the git repository.  It still doesn`t alter the file; it simply places a copy of it in the .git directory.

							(scace) Here is a shortcut that adds all the currently tracked files and commits, combining step 3 and 4.
						</script>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						#### (4. Commit changes)
						# git log
						#### a journal of changes
						```
						> git log
						commit 8e2bf4a56ed63c8921ccffa751f6c1783f4b542e
						Author: J. Harshbarger <hypercubed@gmail.com>

						commit 5053e8cbed15e7e2323fcb15b022847db9863526
						Author: J. Harshbarger <hypercubed@gmail.com>
						Date:   Tue Jun 10 14:25:55 2014 +0900

						    First commit
						```

						Note:
						Another useful command not in the core commands is git log.

					# That's the basics

					Notes: And that is all you really need to get started using git on your local machine.

					<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						#### (branching)
						# git branch
						# git checkout
						### Creates a new branch that doesn''t effect the master.

						```
						> git branch test

						> git checkout test
						Switched to branch 'test'
						```

						- Shortcut: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> `git checkout -b test`

						Note:
						Somewhat more advanced is branching.  If you are not using branching your missing out on one of the best features.  `git branch` creates a new branch while git checkout switches to that branch.  In this chase since the new branch is exactly the same as the previous running git checkout deosnt`t change your files.  You have to remember to do both or use the shortcut. (space)
					</script>
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						#### (branching)
						# git merge
						#### Take changes from one branch and merge them with a second.

						```
						> git checkout master
						Switched to branch 'master'

						> git merge test
						Updating 5053e8c..8e2bf4a
						Fast-forward
						 mydoc.txt           |    1 +
						 scripts/myscript.sh |    1 +
						 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						```

						Note:
						After I've create a new branch, switches to it and committed changes (remember git add and git commit?) I can switch back to another branch and merge changes.  When you do the `git checkout` the files in your file system will change from they way they were in one branch to the other.  Now git is making changes to your files!

					# GIT remotes
					#### GIT remotes are remote locations where you can mirror changes

					- Online (GitHub/Bitbucket)
					- Another machine in your network
					- Over ssh

					```
					> git init --bare //osc-fs/jayson/repos/example.git
					Initialized empty Git repository in //osc-fs/jayson/repos/example.git/

					> git remote add oscfs //osc-fs/jayson/repos/example.git
					> git push oscfs master
					Counting objects: 8, done.
					Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
					Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
					Writing objects: 100% (8/8), 609 bytes, done.
					Total 8 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
					Unpacking objects: 100% (8/8), done.
					To //osc-fs/jayson/repos/example.git
					 * [new branch]      master -> master
					```

					Note:
					`git remote` is how you can share or backup your repo to another location.  You can push your code to github or bitbucket for example or to another machine.... even over ssh.  You see here I've created a new git repository (in this case it is a special bare repository) on osc-fs.  I then added this location to my local repository calling it oscfs.  Then I can easily copy branches from my local machine to osc-fs.
